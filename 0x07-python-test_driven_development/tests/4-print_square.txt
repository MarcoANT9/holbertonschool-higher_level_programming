=    This is the test file for the "4-print_square" module    =
===============================================================

This library is a simple function that writes a square using the
"#" character. This function is called "print_square"it takes one
argument, the size of a square.
=======================================================

Usage
=====
For the module to work propertly, it has to be feed one argument;
the size of the square.

::

>>> squared = __import__('4-print_square').print_square
>>> squared(3)
###
###
###

It can also be zero

>>> squared(0)


It just prints a new line

Error Cases
===========

If the argument is not an integer

>>> squared("Hello_there")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: size must be an integer

>>> squared(3.14)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: size must be an integer

::

If the size is less than zero (makes no physical sense)

>>> squared(-4)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ValueError: size must be >= 0
