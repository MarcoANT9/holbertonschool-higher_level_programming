===============================================================
=     This is the test file for the "3-say_my_name" module    =
===============================================================

This library is a simple function that writes "My name is
<first_name> <last_name>. This function is called "say_my_name"
it takes two arguments, the first and second name (this one is
"" by default) then prints on the stdout.
=======================================================

Usage
=====
For the module to work propertly, it has to be feed two args;
the first one is the "first name", it must be a string, the second
argument, "last name" is optional and must also be a string.

::

>>> say_it = __import__('3-say_my_name').say_my_name
>>> say_it("Marco", "ANT")
My name is Marco ANT


You can also leave the second argument blank

>>> say_it("Marco")
My name is Marco 

(Note: At the end of the last example is a blank space)

Error Cases
===========

Either of the two arguments is not a string.

>>> say_it(2, "Antonio")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: first_name must be a string

>>> say_it("Marco", [1, 2])
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
TypeError: last_name must be a string
